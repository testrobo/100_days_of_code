I saw this stack overflow today and I really love it because it hits so many cool points.

I'm down for anything that makes me lol @ javascript. I honestly think it
becoming so mainstream has actually been one of the biggest fuck ups in
corporate software engineering...

It also shows how in engineering there are 10,000 ways to "skin a cat"
for just about everything.

I think it as an interview question really exercises technical knowledge
in combination with lateral thinking. This in itself emphasizes what
a creative undertaking cs is to begin with.

This is my favorite solution

```
var aﾠ = 1;
var a = 2;
var ﾠa = 3;
if(aﾠ==1 && a== 2 &&ﾠa==3) {
      console.log("Why hello there!")
}
```
